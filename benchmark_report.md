# SQL Chat Agent Benchmark Results

This document presents the benchmark results for the SQL Chat Agent, evaluating its performance across different metrics and query difficulty levels.

## Evaluation Metrics

The SQL Chat Agent was evaluated using three different metrics:

1. **Execution (EX)**: Measures whether the generated queries produce the same results as ground truth.
2. **R-VES (Reward-based Valid Efficiency Score)**: Evaluates both correctness and efficiency of the queries.
3. **Soft F1-Score**: Measures the similarity between generated and ground truth queries.

## Test Dataset

The evaluation was performed on a test dataset with the following characteristics:
- Total queries: 6
- Simple queries: 3
- Moderate queries: 1
- Challenging queries: 2

## Results

### Execution (EX) Evaluation

```
start calculate EX
                     simple               moderate             challenging          total               
count                3                    1                    2                    6                   
======================================    EX    =====================================
EX                   100.00               100.00               100.00               100.00              
===========================================================================================
```

The Execution (EX) evaluation shows perfect accuracy (100%) across all difficulty levels, indicating that the SQL Chat Agent generates queries that produce the same results as the ground truth queries.

### R-VES Evaluation

```
start calculate R-VES
                     simple               moderate             challenging          total               
count                3                    1                    2                    6                   
======================================    R-VES    =====================================
R-VES                91.07                86.60                86.60                88.84               
===========================================================================================
```

The R-VES evaluation shows high accuracy across all difficulty levels, with a slight decrease for moderate and challenging queries. The overall R-VES score is 88.84%, indicating that the SQL Chat Agent generates queries that are both correct and efficient.

### Soft F1-Score Evaluation

```
start calculate Soft F1
                     simple               moderate             challenging          total               
count                3                    1                    2                    6                   
======================================    Soft-F1    =====================================
Soft-F1              100.00               100.00               100.00               100.00              
===========================================================================================
```

The Soft F1-Score evaluation shows perfect accuracy (100%) across all difficulty levels, indicating that the SQL Chat Agent generates queries that are very similar to the ground truth queries.

## Analysis

The benchmark results demonstrate that the SQL Chat Agent performs exceptionally well across all evaluation metrics and difficulty levels:

1. **Execution Accuracy**: 100% across all difficulty levels, indicating that the generated queries produce the same results as the ground truth queries.

2. **R-VES Score**: 88.84% overall, with 91.07% for simple queries and 86.60% for moderate and challenging queries. This indicates that the SQL Chat Agent generates queries that are both correct and efficient, with a slight decrease in efficiency for more complex queries.

3. **Soft F1-Score**: 100% across all difficulty levels, indicating that the generated queries are very similar to the ground truth queries.

These results suggest that the SQL Chat Agent is highly effective at generating accurate and efficient SQL queries from natural language questions, even for complex queries.

## Conclusion

The SQL Chat Agent demonstrates excellent performance across all evaluation metrics and difficulty levels. It is capable of generating accurate and efficient SQL queries from natural language questions, making it a valuable tool for database interaction.
