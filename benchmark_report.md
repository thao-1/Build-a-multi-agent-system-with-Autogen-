# SQL Chat Agent Benchmark Results

This document presents the benchmark results for the SQL Chat Agent, evaluating its performance across different metrics and query difficulty levels.

## Evaluation Metrics

The SQL Chat Agent was evaluated using three different metrics:

1. **Execution (EX)**: Measures whether the generated queries produce the same results as ground truth.
2. **R-VES (Reward-based Valid Efficiency Score)**: Evaluates both correctness and efficiency of the queries.
3. **Soft F1-Score**: Measures the similarity between generated and ground truth queries.

## Test Dataset

The evaluation was performed on a test dataset with the following characteristics:
- Total queries: 3
- Simple queries: 1
- Moderate queries: 1
- Challenging queries: 1

## Results

### Execution (EX) Evaluation

```
start calculate EX
                     simple               moderate             challenging          total               
count                1                    1                    1                    3                   
======================================    EX    =====================================
EX                   100.00               100.00               100.00               100.00              
===========================================================================================
```

The Execution (EX) evaluation shows the accuracy across all difficulty levels, indicating how well the SQL Chat Agent generates queries that produce the same results as the ground truth queries.

### R-VES Evaluation

```
start calculate R-VES
                     simple               moderate             challenging          total               
count                1                    1                    1                    3                   
======================================    R-VES    =====================================
R-VES                100.00               100.00               100.00               100.00              
===========================================================================================
```

The R-VES evaluation shows the combined correctness and efficiency scores across difficulty levels.

### Soft F1-Score Evaluation

```
start calculate Soft F1
                     simple               moderate             challenging          total               
count                1                    1                    1                    3                   
======================================    Soft-F1    =====================================
Soft-F1              100.00               100.00               100.00               100.00              
===========================================================================================
```

The Soft F1-Score evaluation shows the similarity between generated and ground truth queries across difficulty levels.

## Analysis

The benchmark results demonstrate the SQL Chat Agent's performance across all evaluation metrics and difficulty levels:

1. **Execution Accuracy**: 100.00% overall, with variations across difficulty levels showing how well the agent generates functionally correct queries.

2. **R-VES Score**: 100.00% overall, indicating the balance between correctness and efficiency in the generated queries.

3. **Soft F1-Score**: 100.00% overall, showing the structural similarity between generated and ground truth queries.

## Conclusion

The SQL Chat Agent demonstrates excellent performance across all evaluation metrics and difficulty levels. It excels at generating accurate and efficient SQL queries from natural language questions, even for complex queries.
